.CH 1 Unix on today Machines

.hd2 Selecting the right unix machine

.text
 Selecting a Unix machine is not a trivial task for the unnitiated. Several 
 steps must be followed to be sure the hardware is compatible with the software.

 First we have to figure out if there are drivers for the disk controllers, also
 for the display driver, sound card, etc.

.CH 2 Working with text

.hd2 Escape sequences

.text
 Until this chapter, we have only encountered escapes of the form '\^',
 which tell 'sed' not to interpret the circumflex as a special character,
 but rather to take it literally.  For example, '\*' matches a single
 asterisk rather than zero or more backslashes.

.CH 3 Character Encoding
# this is chapter 3

.hd2 UTF-8 and Friends

# the text inside the .text mark should be separated 1 space on the left
.text
 The following example uses the Greek letter Capital Sigma (U+03A3,
 Unicode code point '0x03A3').  In a 'UTF-8' locale, 'sed' correctly
 processes the Sigma as one character despite it being 2 octets (bytes):

# the .console signals to the formatter that this should be represented
# with more padding on the left, I have plans to make this more fancy
.console
 $ locale | grep LANG
 LANG=en_US.UTF-8

 $ printf 'a\u03A3b'
 aU+03A3b

 $ printf 'a\u03A3b' | sed 's/./X/g'
 XXX

 $ printf 'a\u03A3b' | od -tx1 -An
