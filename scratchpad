Some ideas to implement about the projects in this gihub repository

ipscav.sed -
           . The only bug I have pending is the one that doesn't match more than
             one IPv4 address per line. Mi idea is to detect IPS and insert a newline
             after each match by using 's' command. to try to put each ip in his
             own line to then later, do some cleanups, parse and push the results
             through the pipe(2) to awk(1)
