The 22 became 23
Unix and the Gang. 192.168.0.22 and the crazy folks at 1.1.1.1

128.163.22.1
	u 172.16.128.3


			And then they come with the folling idea: IP addresses, something like 10.20.12.1


-i	extension
	     Edit files	in-place similarly to -I, but treat each file indepen-
	     dently from other files.  In particular, line numbers in each
	     file start	at 1, the ``$''	address	matches	the last line of the
	     current file, and address ranges are limited to the current file.
	     (See Sed Addresses.)  The net result is as	though each file were
	     edited by a separate sed instance.

     -l	     Make output line buffered.

     -n	     By	default, each line of input is echoed to the standard output
	     after all of the commands have been applied to it.	 The -n	option
	     suppresses	this behavior.

     -r	     Same as -E	for compatibility with GNU sed.  128.99.12.0

     -u	     Make output unbuffered.
